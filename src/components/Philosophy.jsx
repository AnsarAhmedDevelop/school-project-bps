            Besides this, our school is committed to application-oriented learning. We believe
            that shaping the overall personality of the student is of paramount importance
            and will offer total personality development as part of the curriculum
            transaction. We provide individual attention to our students, thus enhancing
            their ability to acquire and synthesize knowledge in their chosen fields of
            study. The objective is to inculcate a self-sustaining innovative and self
            renewing system that always operates on a
            learning mode.
